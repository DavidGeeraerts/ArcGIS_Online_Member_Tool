#ArcGIS Online Member Tool Bulk Uploader

##Description
The tool is intended to be used with ArcGIS Online by institutions that need to bulk load users into ArcGIS online, such as schools/colleges/Universities, etc.
The tool communicates via RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools) with a Windows Active Directory domain server, to search for a group(s) that contain members to be added to a bulk load operation.

Bulk load users (students) into ArcGIS Online with a properly formatted csv file created from an Offerings Student Group, or any other directory group.
